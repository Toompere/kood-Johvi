# Kood/Jõhvi Portfolio

## About
This repository contains all the projects I completed during my studies at Kood/Jõhvi Technology School between 2022 and 2024. The projects are divided into three main categories: Golang (backend), JavaScript (frontend), and Cybersecurity (specialization). Some projects were completed as part of a team, while others were done individually.
